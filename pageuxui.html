				<h1>Smart Home Run</h1>
				<p>IMA Protect, a security company, has committed the MS MDC to find an innovate way to present their products to their potential clients.</p>
				<p>My group and me, we started to think from the fact that a lot of clients acquire security products following a burglary, a domestic fire, ect.</p>
				<p>So living the experience highlight the need to protect a house, business premises, warehouse or everything else. But rob or burn potential clients houses was not a very good solution, so we imagine to create an immersive experience in a different way.</p>
				<p><br>With their VR demo 'Smart Home' (<a href="https://demo-dev.imaprotect.com/SmartHome/" target="_blank">Link</a>), we created a collaborative game based upon an escape game principle meant to be presented to the customers during exhibitions.</p>
				<p>One client wears the VR headset and one other (or a IMA Protect collaborator on the stand) takes the tablet with the application 'Smart Home Run' (which is on the right). The client with the tablet follows the instructions on it and the client with the VR headset progresses in the house to resolve the situations (alarm, flooding, fire...).</p>
			  <p>Alike in an escape game, they have to get out as quickly as possible and after their success can enter their contact details to participate to the contest.</p>
			  <p>Furthermore to present in an immersive way the products and their security ability, our concept creates some entertainment on the stand. This is also an easy way to collect the clients contact details.</p>

				<h1>Zen Speech</h1>
		  <p>During my specialization in UX/UI Design, I has to imagine an application concept based upon a heartbeat monitor.</p>
		  <p>I thinked of a situation where knowing our own cardiac rhythm should be useful. I recalled that the cardiac rhythm increase in case of stress. There is a lot of stressful situation and I choose one which represents an interest to me : when you have to do a speech !</p>
		  <p><br>As you know, the dry mouth, the butterflies in the stomach and the pouding heart can affect the quality of a speech. <br>With Zen Speech, the user can check the heart rate and calm down his own stress with the relaxation exercices. The app automatically adjusts to the stress level and offers the exercices the user needs to recover his serenity.</p>
		  <p><br>4 different exercices has been requested : describe the application, create a moodboard, a buttons library and 2 interfaces exemples.</p>

				<h1>Pass Path</h1>
				<p>My specialization in UX/UI Design proposed by CalArts, I created an application prototype (mockup). This application should respond to an user issue.</p>
				<p>I choose to respond to a common issue : find the right ticket to buy to do a trip in public transportation. In France, each city system in public transport is different and this is really easy to make a mistake (and get stuck in a station...).</p>
				<p><br>So have an application to guide the user to buy the right ticket for his path seems to be a really good idea ('Find the right ticket' option). To let the user chooses, the application also offer several ticket options (less tickets, cheapest...).</p>
				<p>I thinked to another feature : guiding the user to find where to buy the ticket(s) he chooses ('Find a ticket shop' option).</p>
				<p>The user can also store the trip he wanted and review them in the 'Stored trips' option.</p>
